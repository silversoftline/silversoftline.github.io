Device and usage information: device ID, operating system settings, device hardware information, basic app information and app usage information, network information, mobile carrier information, and HUAWEI ID.

Location information: We may collect, use, and process the fuzzy or accurate location information of your device. The location information is obtained through the GPS, WLAN, and network ID of your service provider.
These third parties may also obtain anonymous information about other applications you’ve downloaded to your mobile device, the mobile websites you visit, your approximate location information (e.g., your postal code), and other non- precise location information in order to help analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising in the app. We allow our partners to serve targeted third-party advertisements or other content (where applicable).
